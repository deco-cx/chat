## üéØ What is deco.chat Agent Workspace?

**deco.chat Agent Workspace** is an open-source platform designed to empower
anyone to quickly create AI agents that don't just communicate through text‚Äîbut
**through rich, interactive UI**. Text is not everything. Your agents should
visually express data, actions, and insights, leveraging an extensible chat
interface that brings powerful UI elements directly into conversations.

Agents built with deco.chat dynamically assemble themselves, connecting
automatically to thousands of high-quality, strongly-typed MCPs (**Model Context
Protocols**) available for popular databases, services, and APIs. This means
your agents seamlessly understand how to interact with your existing tools and
immediately provide value, saving you hours of setup and configuration.
