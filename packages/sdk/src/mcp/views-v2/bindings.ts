/**
 * Views 2.0 Bindings
 *
 * This module provides standardized tool bindings for Views 2.0, a major version upgrade
 * that introduces standardized view management with Resources 2.0 compliance.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Views are Resources 2.0 resources with full CRUD operations
 * - Standardized tool naming: `DECO_RESOURCE_VIEW_*` for CRUD, `deco_view_render_*` for rendering
 * - Full TypeScript support with proper type constraints
 * - Integration with existing binding system and Resources 2.0
 * - Support for multiple view types and render operations
 */

/**
 * Views 2.0 Resource Bindings
 *
 * These bindings provide the standard Resources 2.0 CRUD operations for Views:
 * - DECO_RESOURCE_VIEW_SEARCH - Search view resources with pagination and filtering
 * - DECO_RESOURCE_VIEW_READ - Read a single view resource by URI
 * - DECO_RESOURCE_VIEW_CREATE - Create new view resources (optional)
 * - DECO_RESOURCE_VIEW_UPDATE - Update existing view resources (optional)
 * - DECO_RESOURCE_VIEW_DELETE - Delete view resources (optional)
 *
 * Views are treated as Resources 2.0 resources, so they follow the same patterns
 * as other resource types like workflows and tools.
