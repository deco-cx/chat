# Criar plano para botão de report issue (2025-10-01 11:21Z)

_**User (2025-10-01 11:21Z)**_

Quero criar um plans/report-issue.md com um plano detalhado para implementarmos
uma simples botão de "Report Issue" no nosso sistema

Ele só deve aparecer na tela de um projeto, ao lado esquerda do botão Chat na
top right area do sistema

Não quero que vc crie todo o plano, quero que você cria a parte de report sobre
onde esta o que (quais arquivos precisamos mexer, como o sistema funciona, etc).
Depois começo uma segunda fase sobre como vamos implementar

O desafio funcional envolve criar uma nova tool em algum MCP Team & User
Management e salvar esse dado em algum lugar (no nosso banco). Quero que vc
identifique onde guardamos os dados hoje e provenha o necessario de informacoes
pra o proximo agente montar o plano de implementacao

O desafio de UI é simples:

- Adicionar o botao na topbar
- Ele deve abrir um popover nao tao grande abaixo, com dois campos: Tipo (não
  precisa mostrar o label) - select com Bug/Idea Conteudo (tbm não), textarea

É importante guardar informacoes sobre:

- quem é o usuario
- onde ele esta agora (pagina, url)

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning report file
creation**

I need to create a new file called `report-issue.md` in the specified directory.
The task seems simple, but there's a multi-step process to understand: locating
the topbar component, identifying the chat button, and figuring out the current
UI structure. I also need to explore the Team & User Management area and
consider database storage options like Supabase or Cloudflare D1. I should
search the codebase for where issues are tracked, like “feedback” or “report,”
using the codebase_search tool. **Searching for Chat button details**

I'm going to search for the Chat button, likely located in a `Topbar` or
`Header` component. I'll use the codebase_search tool extensively, possibly
performing multiple searches at once. First, I’ll find mentions of the "Chat"
button in the `apps/web/src/components` folder, as there might be an icon with a
tooltip linked to it. Next, I’ll check where user and authentication context is
accessed, looking at hooks like `useUser` and `useAuth`. Lastly, I need to
identify how the app integrates with analytics and manages issue reporting in
the database. **Identifying data persistence paths**

I need to clarify how our data persistence works, particularly whether
`apps/api` interacts with Supabase. I’ll start by reviewing files like `db.ts`,
along with checking out some migration files. I plan to run multiple searches at
once to gather information. I’ll look for the "Chat" label within the header
components, check where user authentication occurs, and find details on creating
new MCP tools for user management. Additionally, I’ll investigate how the
database layer handles record creation through Supabase or other
methods.</details></think>

I'm going to scan the codebase to locate the topbar/chat button, identify
auth/user context in the web app, find the MCP tools structure for Team & User
Management, and map out the current data persistence path (API and DB) so I can
write the requested report file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating a report on
features**

I’m putting together a report that identifies what needs to change and how the
system works. The user specifically wants details about the MCP tool for
managing teams and users, where data is stored, and what info will be necessary
for the next agent executing the plan. We’re looking at adding a button in the
top bar next to the Chat feature that opens a popover for selecting between a
Bug or an Idea. It’s a bit of a puzzle, but I’m on it! **Locating the Report
Issue button**

I'm figuring out the best spot for a "Report Issue" button. The top-right area,
identified by the `chat-header-end-slot`, has our action buttons. I think it
might get injected through `actionButtons` on the project pages. Now, I need to
track down where `PageLayout` is used, so I will search for it. Let’s see what I
can find by grepping for the `PageLayout` component and where it leads
me!</details></think>

---

I'll look for where the project layout is used to identify where to inject
`actionButtons`, and also locate current top-right chat controls, user context
hooks in the web app, and existing MCP groups for team/user management to know
where to add a tool. Then I'll draft the plans/report-issue.md file with this
mapping.

---

Tool use: **grep**

---

---

I'll gather specifics on the header layout and routing, find user retrieval
hooks in the web app, inspect MCP groups to locate Team/User Management, and
confirm current data storage mechanisms so I can write the mapping report file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating report plans**

I need to produce a report about where to add a "Report Issue" button in the top
bar, specifically next to the chat button on project pages. The code shows that
the PageLayout has an actionButtons slot. Since many pages call PageLayout, I
plan to inject the Report Issue button via this slot. Ideally, this button will
appear only on project routes, located left of the chat button in the top right
area. Let's ensure the button is consistently on project pages! **Implementing
UI popover**

I'm planning to implement a UI popover in the apps/web directory using the
packages for Popover, Select, and Textarea, but without labels—maybe just some
placeholders. I'll also capture user information and the current page URL for
context. I need to get the user context by using the useUser hook from
apps/web/src/hooks/use-user.ts, and I'll also look at the useProfile hook since
the LoggedUser component utilizes it. I'll identify the content path for the
useUser hook.</details></think>

I need to create a plans/report-issue.md file that maps out where everything is
for implementing a "Report Issue" button next to the Chat button on the project

which files to modify and how the current system operates—not the implementation
plan just yet. I’ll also identify where to create a new MCP tool in Team & User
Management and figure out where to store data in the database. I should scan the
UI injection points, relevant React components, and integration with analytics.
**Identifying MCP tools**

I need to look into the MCP Team & User Management area. I found the files
packages/sdk/src/mcp/members/api.ts and teams/api.ts, which are the Team
management tools. So, the new tool might be associated with a group, possibly
WellKnownMcpGroups.Teams or Members. To verify this, I should find the
definition of WellKnownMcpGroups to see which groups exist. I’ll grep for
“groups” in packages/sdk/src/crud/groups.ts.</details></think>

integration**

I need to determine how to add a button only on project pages. Maybe I should
implement it in `PageLayout`, possibly through `actionButtons` injection, or I
could edit `PageLayout` to include the button directly. To ensure reusability,
it might be best to use `actionButtons` for each page, but since they want it
displayed on every project page near the Chat area, a global approach in
`PageLayout` seems better.

I’ll also look into using UI components like `Popover`, `Select`, `Textarea`,
and `Button` from the UI package. We need to ensure we capture user identity
through the `useUser` hook, but I found that the file isn’t located where
expected. I'll check the project layout and explore the hooks directory for more
details.</details></think>

I need to produce a `plans/report-issue.md` file that details the system—like
where things are, how it works, and what files to edit. The user specifically
asked for a report outlining these points. There’s also a second phase planned
for implementation. I'll identify where to store data for a new tool in MCP Team
& User Management and provide info for the next agent to use. I should create
the file with content as the `plans/` directory doesn’t currently exist.
**Mapping UI changes**

I need to include a mapping for the UI, specifically adding a button in the top
bar. The project top bar is located in the PageLayout's top-right area, where
the `actionButtons` slot and `ToggleDecopilotButton` are situated. The
requirement is clear: the button should appear on project screens, to the left
of the Chat button. Since PageLayout displays `actionButtons`, I’ll position our
"Report Issue" button before the ToggleDecopilotButton. I also need to outline
how PageLayout is used and whether to pass the `actionButtons` prop or create a
global injection. **Mapping button integration and data retrieval**

I need to determine where to add a new top bar button component, likely in
PageLayout since it's consistent across project pages. I can position our button
in the `chat-header-end-slot` near the ToggleDecopilotButton. It's essential to
outline how to retrieve user context with the `useUser` hook, which fetches user
data via MCP `PROFILES_GET`. For current page location, I can use
`useLocation()` from react-router, which is already referenced in
`Sidebar/footer.tsx`. I also need to locate MCP Team & User Management for
adding a new tool that will save reported issues to the database using Supabase.
**Developing an API for issue reporting**

I need to create an API MCP tool that will write data into a Supabase table. I
suspect there aren’t any existing entities for reporting issues. While I could
write to a durable object workspace DB, team-related data should reside in
Supabase. I should locate where the Team tools implement server-side endpoints,
likely in `packages/sdk/src/mcp/teams/api.ts`. The actual server implementation
is probably in `apps/api`, and I want to search for TEAMS_* tools using grep for
functions like TEAMS_GET.</details></think>

---

I'll search where MCP team and member tools are handled on the API side, and
inspect how tools are wired to database operations so I can point out where to
add a new "Report Issue" tool and how it would persist to Supabase.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning report for user
issue**

I need to create a `plans/report-issue.md` file, focusing on a detailed mapping
without going into a full implementation plan. The user wants specific details
in Portuguese, like where everything is located — essentially a report on
requirements and how the system works. There's mention of adding a tool in some
MCP Team & User Management, and saving data in a database. Plus, there's a UI
challenge involving a new button on the project screen! **Mapping the report
issue button**

I need to design a popover for reporting issues that allows selecting between
"Bug" and "Idea" and includes a textarea for content. It's key to capture the
user's information and the current page URL. For the button placement, the
topbar on the project screen can be found within the `PageLayout`, which also
has `actionButtons` and the chat icon. The requirement is that it should only
appear on project pages, so I’ll ensure it integrates with `ProjectLayout`
accordingly. **Finalizing button placement**

I've figured out the button placement! In `PageLayout`, the button can be
rendered within `{actionButtons}`, positioning it to the left of the chat button
smoothly. It makes sense to pass the button across project pages to keep it
consistent. However, to make it appear only on project-related screens (and not
on the home page or other layouts), I’ll add it directly into `PageLayout`
before the chat toggle.

As for user context, I'll be using the `useUser` and `useProfile` hooks to
retrieve relevant user data. Additionally, I’m creating a tool group for "Team &
User Management" within the SDK. **Setting up issue reporting tool**

I’m planning to add a new tool, either `TEAM_MEMBER_REPORT_ISSUE` or
`TEAM_REPORT_ISSUE`, within this module group. The question is where to store
the data. The code interacts with `c.db` in Supabase, so I need to check for
existing tables we can use or potentially create a new one. There's a
`user_activity` table, which logs various activities. It could work to store
reports in a new `issues` table, but I should also look into any `audit`
features. Let's search for any existing `issues` tables next.</details></think>

Tool use: **grep**

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating a mapping report**

I've got to produce a detailed mapping report that outlines where everything is
and how the system functions. The user specifically asked for information about
"where is what" and details for the next agent to plan implementation, rather
than a full plan. I have tools available for creating a new file, and it seems
like "apply_patch" is the preferred option. Although this task is simple, it
involves multiple steps. I'll think about status updates, but maybe skipping the
todo for a straightforward document is okay. **Producing the report file**

I'm working on a single document, so I think I can skip the todo, even though
there's a non-compliance reminder about updating it. That reminder is automated,
but it's optional. My goal is to create the file using the "apply_patch" tool
and add it at the specified path. The document will include the scope for adding
a "Report Issue" button next to the chat button in the project pages.

I'll note the injection point and UI components available as well. **Applying
design system guidelines**

I need to follow the design system guidelines for this task.

First, I’ll use the `useUser` hook to retrieve user data and location info. This
will involve using `window.location.href` or `useLocation()` to capture the
current URL.

Next, a new tool needs to be created under the Team & User Management group in
the specified location. I’ll also introduce a new table in the database for
capturing issues, likely named `issues` or `deco_chat_issues`. Finally, I'll
note where the MCP tools are registered. **Implementing new MCP tools**

I need to add the new tool in the SDK MCP modules, which will make it available
server-side. On the web side, we’ll use the `@deco/sdk` MCPClient to call the
new tool, likely named something like `MCPClient.TEAM_REPORT_ISSUE_CREATE`.

For reporting issues, I could either add a hook or function in the hooks
directory or call it directly. I also need to ensure that the button only
appears on project detail pages by passing the `actionButtons` from those
specific pages. **Identifying project routes**

I noticed that the `breadcrumb={<ChatHeader />}` is found in
`apps/web/src/components/agent/chat.tsx`, and many components use `PageLayout`.
Now I need to determine which routes correspond to "project." I think checking
`apps/web/src/main.tsx` for the routing definitions will help. By reviewing the
routes there, I should be able to clearly define the path for the
project-related screens. This will help ensure the functionality works as
intended.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning UI Adjustments**

I need to create a new file, `plans/report-issue.md`, to map out where to add a
code feature. The Report Issue button is supposed to be next to the Chat button
at the top-right of the project screen. In `project.tsx`, there's an
`actionButtons` slot where the `ToggleDecopilotButton` is located. Since
`PageLayout` is used for all project subpages, adding the button in this layout
ensures consistency across screens. The UI elements, like `popover` and
`select`, make this addition straightforward. **Creating a Modification Report**

The user clarified that they don't want a full plan but rather a report
detailing which files to modify and how the system operates. My focus is to
provide information for the next agent to implement. There's a challenge of
creating a new tool for the MCP Team & User Management and saving data in a
database. I'll identify the relevant section in `api.ts` to include `createTool`
for "Team & User Management" and suggest naming it something like
"TEAM_REPORT_ISSUE_CREATE." The data persistence will be through Supabase, so
I'll check for existing tables related to issues or user feedback. If none
exist, I need to search for past references to issues.</details></think>

---

Tool use: **grep**

---

I identified the header and top-right area in
`apps/web/src/components/layout/project.tsx`, the `actionButtons` slot and the
existing Chat toggle, the project-only routes, and the user/context hooks. I
also traced how MCP tools in the Team & User Management group are defined and
how they persist data via Supabase (`c.db`). I’ll now create
`plans/report-issue.md` containing the mapping of where everything is and what
needs editing, without implementation steps.

---

Tool use: **apply_patch**

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Preparing task updates**

I need to provide a status update and summary since I used tools for this task.
It involves creating a plans/report-issue.md file, which is relatively
straightforward. The system mentions making todo lists for medium-to-large
tasks, but since this seems small, it’s just gathering and writing the document.
The final message needs an update before the tool call batch. I'll also check
for lints on edited files; however, it might not be necessary for a markdown
file. **Reviewing lint instructions and updating**

The instructions indicate that I should run read_lints after changes to check
for linter errors. However, it’s unclear if I need to run it for non-code files.
We edited one file, but linter errors could be global and might not apply to
markdown. It seems safe to skip for that. I need to follow "citing_code" rules
for references in the markdown. Finally, I’ll confirm the created file and
summarize where edits should be made. **Finalizing status update and summary**

I need to mention that feature flags and analytics rules apply. The user
provided posthog integration rules, but we don't necessarily have to integrate
analytics. It's important to store information about who the user is and where
they are now, which we've included in the mapping. I will provide a final status
update and summary as per the spec. We didn't create a todo list, so that part
can be skipped. I'll compile a brief summary with key code references and point

I created the discovery report with exact locations for the topbar slot,
user/location context, MCP group to extend, and persistence path; next we can
plan implementation details.

- I added `plans/report-issue.md` with:
  - Where to place the button on project pages:
    `apps/web/src/components/layout/project.tsx` in the `actionButtons` area
    before the existing Chat toggle.
  - How to ensure it only appears on project routes: they all render
    `PageLayout` under `/:org/:project` in `apps/web/src/main.tsx`.
  - How to get user and page context: `useUser()` from
    `apps/web/src/hooks/use-user.ts`, `useParams()` for `org/project`, and
    `useLocation()`/`globalThis.location.href` for URL/path.
  - Where to add the MCP tool: `packages/sdk/src/mcp/members/api.ts` (Team &
    User Management group) with `c.db` Supabase persistence.
  - Noted that there’s no issues table yet; outlined a minimal schema to create
    via a new SQL migration in `supabase/migrations`.

- File:
  - `plans/report-issue.md` now documents all of the above with precise code
    references and concrete file paths.

- Key takeaways for the next phase:
  - UI: inject a “Report Issue” button via `actionButtons` in `PageLayout`; use
    `@deco/ui` `Popover`, `Select` (Bug/Idea), and `Textarea`.
  - Data: capture `user.id/email`, `org`, `project`, `pathname`, and full
    `href`.
  - Backend: add a new MCP tool (e.g., `TEAM_REPORT_ISSUE_CREATE`) in
    `packages/sdk/src/mcp/members/api.ts`; create `deco_chat_issues` migration.

Alguns ajustes:

- Verifique como a gente incluiu o botão Chat que tem a logo da deco. Quero bem
  proximo a ele e sem repeticoes ou coisas loucas

Agora, complete o documento com o planejamento da implementacao baseado no que
eu pedi acima e no que já foi descoberto.

Ainda não implemente

Vou verificar como o botão Chat com logo da deco foi incluído e então completar
o documento com o planejamento de implementação detalhado.

Perfeito! Agora entendi o padrão exato. O botão Chat usa simplesmente
`<Icon name="chat" />` sem logo da deco - usa um ícone do sistema de ícones. Ele
aparece condicionalmente via `preferences.enableDecopilot` e está logo após
`{actionButtons}`. Vou atualizar o documento com o planejamento completo da
implementação.
