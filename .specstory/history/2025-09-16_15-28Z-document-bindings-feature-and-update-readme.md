# Document bindings feature and update README (2025-09-16 15:28Z)

_**User (2025-09-16 15:28Z)**_

Profundly investigate this repo and document the Bindings feature and also
document the examples

Create a link from README.md to BINDINGS.md and also add it on the docs (you'll
have to copy)

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating bindings
documentation**

I need to thoroughly explore the codebase to understand the "Bindings feature"
and its examples. The likely starting point is the
packages/runtime/src/bindings.ts file. I’ll read that and any related files for
relevant information. I should also check the docs directory for examples or
documentation. The instructions say to create a BINDINGS.md file to document
this feature, probably at the repo root, and then link it from README.md. I'll
get started on that! **Preparing bindings documentation**

It looks like I need to copy the content of BINDINGS.md into the docs site,
specifically into MDX pages under `docs/view/content`. I'll likely create a new
MDX page, formatting it for Astro content. I need to consider adding it as
`docs/view/content/docs/bindings.mdx` with the right frontmatter. Following the
developer's instructions, I'll create a list of tasks: investigate bindings,
draft docs, create BINDINGS.md, link it from README, copy to docs, and verify
the build. I'll also run searches for "bindings" in the codebase to find
examples. **Structuring bindings documentation**

I need to make sure to avoid heavy formatting since the instructions say to use
markdown sparingly. However, BINDINGS.md will still be a Markdown file, and I’ll
write it using apply_patch. I also need to insert a link in README.md and create
a new MDX page in `docs/view/content`. To understand the docs structure, I'll
review the 21 MDX files in that directory. I’ll list the directory and also use
codebase_search to find details in bindings.ts, but reading the file may be a
better approach. **Executing parallel tool calls**

I’m starting with a status update, following tool-calling rules, before I run my
first batch of tools. I'll execute several parallel tool calls: first, I’ll do a
broad codebase search with the query “How do Bindings work?” Then I’ll grep for
the term "bindings" across the entire repository to find its usage. I also plan
to read the content of packages/runtime/src/bindings.ts and check the exports in
packages/runtime/src/index.ts. Plus, I’ll search for "bindings" semantics in the
runtime directory and investigate its usage in the apps/api and apps/web
directories. Let’s go!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the codebase to locate and understand the Bindings feature, find
examples and usages across packages and apps, and identify where to add
documentation in the docs site. Then I'll draft and add BINDINGS.md, link it
from README.md, and copy it into the docs as an MDX page.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating repo
documentation**

I need to really dig into this repository and document the Bindings feature,
along with examples. First, I’ll create a BINDINGS.md file at the root and link
it from README.md. Then, I’ll also add this to the documentation site as an MDX
page. I should create actionable todos: 1) Explore the bindings feature across
packages, 2) Draft BINDINGS.md with detailed information, 3) Update the README
link, and 4) Add the docs to the appropriate location in the docs site
structure, possibly under guides/. **Organizing documentation content**

I need to ensure we place the new content in the appropriate path, checking
docs/view/src/content/config, and creating a content file. I noticed there’s
already a README.md in packages/sdk/src/mcp/bindings, which contains some
relevant explanations. I should incorporate that information and expand it to
include details about the runtime side of bindings found in
packages/runtime/src. This includes how the environment variable DECO_BINDINGS
is encoded as a base64 JSON list of Binding union types defined in
packages/runtime/src/wrangler.ts. I'll read that file for more information on
the Binding types.</details></think>

---

I'll read the key files defining bindings types and configuration to document
accurately, and locate example usages to include. Then I'll create BINDINGS.md,
update README.md with a link, and copy the content into the docs site as a new
MDX page.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating bindings
feature**

I need to thoroughly explore this repository to document the Bindings feature,
including examples. It looks like there are two different "Bindings" concepts to
understand.

First, in `packages/runtime/src`, there are `bindings.ts` and `wrangler.ts`,
which define how Worker environment bindings work. Then, in
`packages/sdk/src/mcp/bindings`, there's another concept relating to MCP tool
binding definitions.

I need to link these findings to the `README.md` and ensure proper documentation
in `BINDINGS.md`. **Creating BINDINGS.md**

It seems like I need to summarize both runtime Bindings and MCP binding schema
into a new `BINDINGS.md` at the repo's root. I'll link this from the `README.md`
and also copy the content into the documentation site.

The site uses Astro, so I should review the existing files in
`docs/view/src/content/en`, especially looking for sections like
`project-structure.mdx` and `guides/deployment.mdx`. I might want to add a new
MDX page under guides or reference and possibly update the navigation.
Additionally, I’ll explore reusing content from the `README.md` in
`packages/sdk/src/mcp/bindings`. I'll look for any references to
`BindingSelector` and triggers too!</details></think>

---

I'll scan existing docs structure and components mentioning bindings to capture
examples and decide where to place the new docs page. Then I'll draft
BINDINGS.md at the repo root, add a link in README.md, and copy it into the docs
site as an MDX page.

---

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring page discovery**

I'm looking into the `docs/view` directory, where I see `i18n` and
`content.config.ts` files. I want to check how these files contribute to the
process of discovering pages. It's essential to understand their role in the
setup to ensure everything functions correctly for our needs. Analyzing the
configuration will help me get a clearer picture of how pages are organized and
accessed. Let's see what I find!</details></think>

---

I'll create a small implementation plan and then read the docs config to place
the new page correctly. Next, I'll draft BINDINGS.md, link it in README.md, and
copy it into the docs site under the appropriate folder.

---

## Todo List

- [-] Investigate bindings feature across runtime and SDK to document it
- [ ] Write BINDINGS.md at repo root explaining concept, API, and examples
- [ ] Link BINDINGS.md from README.md
- [ ] Copy BINDINGS.md into docs site as MDX page and wire it

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Consolidating bindings
documentation**

I’m planning to consolidate runtime bindings and SDK MCP bindings documentation
into a file called BINDINGS.md. I want to include examples from the apps, such
as the BindingSelector component and its usage in settings/channels. I’ll also
document the configuration process using wrangler config, like how to inject
deco.bindings and handle the encoded DECO_BINDINGS string.

After drafting the content, I’ll update the README.md to include a link and
check the structure of existing documents to know where to insert it.
**Performing parallel reads**

I’m planning to perform parallel reads on a few files, including the root
README.md, the package binding README.md, and the docs content tree. I want to
check if there’s useful information I can reuse or expand. I’ll also look at the
apps/api/wrangler.toml to see if it includes the deco.bindings configuration and
check the packages/cli helpers for generating DECO_BINDINGS. Keeping things
minimal seems best, so I’ll run these parallel calls for
efficiency.</details></think>

---

I’m going to read the existing README, the SDK bindings README, the docs site
content config and pages to see how to add a new MDX page, and a sample
wrangler.toml for bindings configuration. Then I’ll create BINDINGS.md, link it
in README.md, and add a docs page.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring configuration in
Wrangler**

I’m focused on showing how to configure the `wrangler.toml` for design-time
settings. The runtime utilizes `env.DECO_BINDINGS`, which is a base64 JSON
string from `Binding[]`. I think it gets set through the deployment pipeline by
merging `deco.bindings` into the `DECO_BINDINGS` variable. The CLI likely
manages this. I should provide clear instructions for using the `deco` tool to
set the environment variable and show examples of defining bindings and
accessing them correctly.</details></think>

---

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying API documentation
details**

I need to provide clear documentation on several elements. I’m thinking about
the Binding schema, the files binder.ts and utils.ts, and WellKnownBindings.
Additionally, I want to cover how to use these in the UI, how to check
implementations, and the process of creating a typed client. I also need to
mention runtime binding injection using wrangler’s `deco.bindings` configuration
and the `DECO_BINDINGS` env var parse, alongside how `withBindings` sets env
variables for the client name. **Providing code examples for bindings**

I should include some code examples. First, I need to define the binding schema
using zod. Then, I can show how to use the `Binding` utility to check if an
integration implements a binding with a list of tools. The next step is to
demonstrate using `bindingClient` for `.implements` and `.forConnection`, along
with a UI BindingSelector sample.

For runtime, I'll show a wrangler config example for `deco.bindings`. However,
it appears that the `wrangler.toml` in this repo doesn’t include
`deco.bindings`, despite the `WranglerConfig` interface suggesting support. I'll
provide an example for clarity. **Focusing on usage examples in worker
environment**

I need to include an example of usage in the worker environment. It could look
like this:

```javascript
const { fetch } = withRuntime({
  tools: [ ... ],
  fetch: async (req, env) => {
     const slack = env["CHANNELS"]; // typed client?
     await slack.POST_MESSAGE({ ... });
     ...
  }
});
```

However, I also notice that `createIntegrationBinding` returns an MCPClient for
the connection. The generated `deco.gen.ts` might include typed tool calls, but
I’ll focus on the general pattern instead. Essentially, `env[name]` should be a
client object that implements tool method proxies or an MCPClient. In
`index.ts`, `env[binding.name]` is set using the
`creatorByType[binding.type](...)`.

The MCPClient gets created with `MCPClient.forConnection`, which has dynamic
invocation semantics—though the implementation is unknown. With
`withDefaultBindings`, they set up an `env["SELF"]` proxy for calling server
tools by ID. So, I need to avoid over-claiming the typed shape and focus on
configuration and access. Lastly, I’ll implement file changes using the tools to
apply patches or edit files. **Updating documentation files**

I need to use `apply_patch` to create a new file called `BINDINGS.md` at the
root of the repo and also copy its content to an MDX file for the docs.
Additionally, I should update the `README.md`. I'll check where to place the new
link and likely add a section titled "Further Reading" or mention "Bindings"
under "Building Blocks."

It seems I should add this section either after "Building Blocks" or before
"Project Layout." For the docs page, I’ll ensure to include frontmatter with
`title`, `description`, and maybe even an `icon`. I’ll mark it lighter content
while keeping the instructions to copy from `BINDINGS.md`.

Even though the linter won't check docs files, I still want to ensure everything
is properly formatted. I won't output code to the user; I'll stick to using
`apply_patch` for file creations and README modifications. **Organizing todo
list and drafting BINDINGS.md**

I need to manage the todo list effectively. First, I’ll mark
"todo-bindings-investigate" as completed. Next, I should set "write md" to
in_progress before making edits. I’ll update the todos to reflect that I’ve
completed the investigation and set "write md" as in_progress.

Following that, I’ll create the `BINDINGS.md` file and prepare content sections,
including an overview, types of bindings, concepts, examples, and an API
reference. I’ll focus on the essential details without quoting exact code
snippets, keeping things generic. Once I draft it, I’ll perform the necessary
TODO updates, apply the patch, and update the README with a link to the new
documentation.</details></think>

---

I’m marking the investigation task complete and starting the BINDINGS.md
authoring. Then I'll create the file, update README with a link, and add the
docs MDX copy.

- I scanned runtime and SDK to map how bindings are defined, parsed, and used.
  Now I’ll add the docs and wire links.

- Created `BINDINGS.md`, linked it from `README.md`, and added a docs page under
  `docs/view/src/content/en/reference/bindings.mdx`.

- All tasks are complete.

- Changes made:
  - Added `BINDINGS.md` at the repo root with concept, runtime flow,
    configuration, and examples.
  - Updated `README.md` with a note linking to `BINDINGS.md`.
  - Added docs page `docs/view/src/content/en/reference/bindings.mdx` mirroring
    key content for the site.

- Key files to review:
  - `packages/runtime/src/index.ts` (withBindings/withRuntime),
    `packages/runtime/src/bindings.ts`, `packages/runtime/src/wrangler.ts`
    (Binding types).
  - `packages/sdk/src/mcp/bindings/*` (WellKnownBindings, binder utilities).
  - UI usage in `apps/web/src/components/settings/channels.tsx` and
    `.../integrations/connection-detail.tsx`.

Would you like me to also add sidebar navigation entries in the Astro config to
surface the Bindings page prominently?

You're absolutely right! Let me investigate the "resources" binding specifically
to understand what it is and how it works.

Perfect! Now I understand. You're absolutely right - there are **two different
concepts** both called "bindings":

1. **Runtime bindings** (what I documented) - for wiring integrations into your
   app environment
2. **Resources binding** (what you're referring to) - a standardized MCP binding
   schema that defines how integrations should implement resource operations

Let me update the documentation to properly explain both concepts:

Ah, I see! You want me to document **MCP Binding Schemas** as the main concept,
where Resources and Channels are examples of well-known binding schemas that
define standardized tool contracts. Let me rewrite the documentation to focus on

- ## SDK bindings in the UI
- 
- Use SDK utilities to verify an integration implements a well-known binding before enabling a feature.
+ ## Checking Binding Implementation

```ts
import { Binding, WellKnownBindings } from "@deco/sdk/mcp/bindings";
- const ok = await Binding(WellKnownBindings.Resources).implements(connectionTools);
+ 
+ const hasResources = await Binding(WellKnownBindings.Resources).implements(
+   integration.tools
+ );
````

- See also `packages/sdk/src/mcp/bindings/README.md` for more patterns and
  examples.

* See the full [Bindings documentation](../../../../BINDINGS.md) for complete
  details.

```

## Todo List

- [x] Investigate bindings feature across runtime and SDK to document it
- [x] Write BINDINGS.md at repo root explaining concept, API, and examples
- [x] Link BINDINGS.md from README.md
- [x] Copy BINDINGS.md into docs site as MDX page and wire it

---

Perfect! I've completely rewritten the documentation to focus on the correct understanding of bindings:

## What I've documented:

**Bindings** are standardized tool contracts that define what methods an integration (MCP) must implement to be compatible with specific features. 

### Well-Known Bindings:
- **Resources binding** - defines tools for managing resources (read, search, create, update, delete, list)
- **Channels binding** - defines tools for managing communication channels  
- **View binding** - defines tools for rendering UI components

### Key points covered:
1. **Binding schemas** as contracts with required tool names and Zod schemas
2. **Resources binding** as the primary example with all its tools
3. **Implementation** via the `resources` option in `withRuntime`
4. **Runtime integration** - how the system auto-generates standardized tools
5. **Client-side checking** - using `Binding(WellKnownBindings.Resources).implements()`
6. **Creating custom bindings** with step-by-step examples
7. **Typed clients** for server-side usage

### Files updated:
- `BINDINGS.md` - Complete rewrite focusing on MCP binding schemas
- `README.md` - Link to BINDINGS.md (already done)
- `docs/view/src/content/en/reference/bindings.mdx` - Condensed docs page with link to full docs

The documentation now correctly presents Resources and Channels as examples of well-known binding schemas, not as separate concepts from bindings.
