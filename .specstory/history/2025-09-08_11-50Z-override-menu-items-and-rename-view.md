# Override menu items and rename view (2025-09-08 11:50Z)

_**User (2025-09-07 22:29Z)**_

I want to override the menu items. Ive added consoles to copy

This is the value

In a very simple way

do as i tole before and Make a change to rename the decopilot view and send to
localhost:8787/

I want to change just the initial state, not fro the api call

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting menu items**

I need to override the menu items, specifically to rename the decopilot view and
send it to localhost:8787. It seems they want to change the initial state rather
than using an API call. They've provided a value array for the menu items, and
I’m guessing "DECONFIG Branch Manager" or “decopilot view” are possible names.
The instruction to "send to localhost:8787" likely means opening a link locally.
I need to locate the initial state, modified files include sidebar/index.tsx and
others related to menu events. **Searching for sidebar initial values**

The file I’m looking at is around line 99, and it seems like the sidebar menu
responds to iframe events for overriding the menu. However, the request is to
change the initial state instead of relying on an API call. I need to find the
default values used before any API overrides, so I’ll explore the code.

I plan to use codebase_search to look for terms like 'menu', 'sidebar', and
'use-iframe-menu-events' in apps/web, as well as the initial state of the
default menu items. It’s important to provide a status update before running
these parallel searches.</details></think>

---

I'll locate where the sidebar menu's initial state is defined and update the
default item to rename "decopilot" and point it to localhost:8787, without
touching the API-driven updates. Now I'll search the web app for the sidebar and
menu initialization.

I'll search for where "decopilot" or a similar view is referenced to ensure the
correct item is modified, and then update the initial state array in the iframe
menu hook so it overrides API data.

Ops, sorry. It's not decopilot. It's notebook

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Mapping menu items**

The JSON reveals first-level default items like connections, agents, and views,
along with a custom integration called "DECONFIG Branch Manager." It seems the
user wants to set these as initial menu items. They specifically requested to
rename the decopilot view and direct it to localhost:8787/, now correctly
phrased as "notebook view." I need to find a related "notebook" view, so I'll
search for that in the codebase. The JSON types "default" and "custom" indicate
the expected view models while configuring the menu. **Configuring integration
views**

This is an integration app that should likely be set as "top-level" since it’s a
custom view. If they want a tree structure under integration, the parentId needs
to be the integration ID. The WorkspaceViews groups direct views under the
"Custom" section. I see that first level views are grouped by type, with the
code treating custom views differently. There's a filter for displaying "MCPs"
that excludes certain items, and we need to ensure that the initial state sets
the IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE quickly. I should look further into the hook to
find where this state is applied on load.</details></think>

---

I’m going to open the `use-iframe-menu-events.ts` hook to confirm how
`IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE` is applied and then update it to include your simple
initial set, renaming the notebook view to point to `http://localhost:8787/`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying initial state**

I need to change the initial state to override menu items, specifically renaming
"decopilot" to "notebook" as per the user's instructions. They mentioned editing
just the initial state, not the API call. I’ll have to adjust the file
`apps/web/src/hooks/use-iframe-menu-events.ts` to set the
`IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE` correctly for the MenuViewDefinition. The provided
array has 'default' and 'custom' types, which should match our
MenuViewDefinition type. I want to ensure I understand the application of
IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE for seeding the menu. **Updating menu initialization**

I see there’s a helper function `useApplyMenuViews()`, which is utilized in
sidebar/index.tsx between lines 733-752. This section seeds the menu for
development using `applyMenuViews`, but it seems the initial state constant
isn’t currently applied anywhere. To ensure the `IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE` is
set properly, I’ll likely need to modify the code to apply it automatically on
mount, either in Sidebar/AppSidebar or within the `useIframeMenuEvents` hook.
The user emphasized they just want to handle the initial state, specifically
renaming "decopilot" to "notebook" and pointing it to localhost:8787/.
**Renaming menu items**

I’m considering the menu icon for 'views,' which could be renamed to 'Notebook'
as the user intended. The provided array includes a menu item titled 'Views'
with the id 'views.' They corrected the view name from "decopilot" to
"notebook". They want 'Notebook' to link to 'http://localhost:8787/'. I'm
curious about where this link is applied in the code. The function for custom
views adds a query string using `metadata.url`. If we add 'Notebook' to
`IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE` with the appropriate metadata, it should fit into
the team’s views structure. **Understanding view classification**

I’m realizing that in the code, views get pushed into firstLevelViews when they
lack an integrationId and aren’t custom types. If I add a 'custom' view with
integrationId set to 'custom', it won’t appear in firstLevelViews but will be
categorized under 'fromIntegration["custom"]'. Now, do they show a "Custom"
section? The code loops through entries and has a special case for 'custom'
views. I see that the user wants a straightforward solution: just rename 'Views'
to 'Notebook' and set the route to /views. **Implementing initial state
changes**

The user is being quite specific about using the `use-iframe-menu-events.ts`
file and appears to want to take JSON data from WorkspaceViews and paste it into
`IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE`. I need to convert this array to
`MenuViewDefinition` items, renaming "DECONFIG Branch Manager" to "Notebook" and
setting the URL to 'http://localhost:8787/'. They want this change applied at
startup, not from an API call. I'll implement the initial state logic in
`use-iframe-menu-events.ts`, possibly integrating it into `WorkspaceViews` so
that these views display properly without calling the API. **Implementing custom
views**

To set up a custom item pointing to an external URL, I’ll update the
`metadata.url` at the view. For default items like 'connections', I'll ensure
they aren't set as 'custom' and get the appropriate metadata. The user wants to
rename 'views' to 'Notebook' with the new URL 'http://localhost:8787/'. Even
though the initial JSON didn’t include 'notebook', I can modify the item with id
'views' accordingly.

Since they want to adjust `IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE` to include this content,
I’ll implement it in `use-iframe-menu-events.ts` and ensure `WorkspaceViews`
uses it if it's not empty. I’ll also make sure to prioritize this when mapping
views in `WorkspaceViews`.</details></think>

I'll search for any existing "Notebook" view references to ensure we update the

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Renaming the menu view**

I need to change the initial state of the menu, focusing on modifying the
"Notebook" view to link to localhost:8787. The user mentioned wanting to rename
the decopilot view but then corrected it to be the Notebook view. They
emphasized that the change should not come from an API call. So, I should focus
on adjusting the initial state used by the menu before fetching the remote team
views, which seem tied to the current API team's data. **Adjusting menu views**

I can use the dev-only seed effect at AppSidebar, but that eventually uses
`useApplyMenuViews()`, leading to an API call, which the user wants to avoid.
Instead, I can change the initial mapping in `WorkspaceViews` by creating a
default `firstLevelViews` from a hardcoded array when `team?.views` is empty.

I just want to cahgent eh menu to screenshare

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering menu changes**

I need to make a simple change to override initial menu items and rename the
notebook view while sending it to a specific location. However, the user wants
to change just the initial state, avoiding an API call. They’ve mentioned that
the current menu is based on "WorkspaceViews" and uses team data. Since this is
for a one-off demo, I can potentially use existing code in `AppSidebar` with the
dev seeding. But I should avoid SDK persistence since that involves API calls.
**Clarifying menu changes**

I need to figure out where `team.views` originates. The `useCurrentTeam` hook
likely fetches the team context from the API. However, I could modify
`WorkspaceViews` for local development by replacing `firstLevelViews` with a
hardcoded array when a flag is set. The user wants menu items like "My Apps,"
"Agents," and a custom item with a specific URL. They initially referenced
"decopilot" but then clarified it as "notebook" and now want to change that to
"screenshare." **Renaming the Notebook view**

The user wants to rename the "Notebook" view to "Screenshare" and link it to
`http://localhost:8787/`. They specifically want to override the initial state
without persistence. The menu items are built using `team.views` from the
server. To achieve this, I can modify `WorkspaceViews` by adding a check for a
development flag and then transform `firstLevelViews`. I’ll look for the
"Notebook" item and update its title, while keeping its icon the same and
changing the URL. I need to confirm where "Notebook" is defined in the code.
**Searching for Notebook**

I realized I didn’t search for "Notebook" earlier, which was a mistake since it
didn’t show up in my previous grep results. I need to run a new grep to find all
instances of "Notebook" in the code. This will help confirm where it's defined
and ensure I can make the necessary changes. I'll make sure to double-check my
search parameters to capture everything related to "Notebook." This should set
me on the right track!</details></think>

---

I'll quickly search the codebase for any "Notebook" menu view reference to
modify it in the sidebar component without hitting the API.

---

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying user
requirements**

The user's request involves changing the initial state of menu items and
renaming "decopilot view" to "notebook." They also want to send this change to
localhost:8787, emphasizing that this should only affect the initial state, not
the API call. They mentioned wanting to change the menu item to "screenshare."
The conversation is a bit tangled. I need to locate where the current menu is
generated to implement these changes correctly in the codebase. **Evaluating
menu configuration**

I’m looking at the top-level built-in items, like "New chat" and "Discover,"
which are static. The user wants to override the initial state from
`team?.views`, not from the API. There’s a dev seeding code based on an
environment variable that affects how the menu gets built. I need to avoid
calling `addView` to persist changes to the server and instead adjust what
renders in the sidebar initially with a hardcoded list for this demo. A minimal
fix might involve short-circuiting `WorkspaceViews` if an environment flag is
set. **Implementing static fallback**

I’m instructed to create a simple static fallback for views in `WorkspaceViews`
for a one-off demo. If the environment variable `VITE_DEMO_MENU_OVERRIDE` is set
to "1", I’ll ignore `team?.views` and use a constant derived from the user's
JSON list, renaming "Notebook" to "Screenshare." The user mentioned wanting to
change the menu to "screenshare" and send it to localhost:8787. Even though I
couldn't find "Notebook" in the code, it seems it may come from the API, which
we need to avoid. **Setting up static "Screenshare" view**

It looks like I can't find "Notebook" in the code, suggesting that it might come
from the API, which the user wants to avoid. Instead, I can create a top-level
custom item called "Screenshare" that points to localhost:8787. To do this, I
could inject a `demoViews` array into `WorkspaceViews`, using it if the
`VITE_DEMO_MENU_OVERRIDE` flag is set. Since the user wants a simple, one-off
change, I'll check a constant before falling back on `team?.views` to keep it
straightforward and avoid unnecessary complexity. **Creating a "Screenshare"
view**

Given the user's requirements, I'll map their items to fit the `View` structure.
I can create a new constant called `DEMO_MENU_VIEWS` in the code, replacing the
existing views with "Screenshare" pointing to localhost:8787. Since the user
wants minimal complexity, I’ll define the "Screenshare" view as a custom type
with the necessary parameters, ensuring it links correctly without using an API.
Setting it up this way should keep it simple and meet their request without
overcomplicating the implementation. I'll confirm that the routing in the
"ViewDetail" uses the correct query parameters for loading the
iframe.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing menu changes**

I need to replace the custom menu item "DECONFIG Branch Manager" with
"Notebook." There seems to be some confusion about a typo, as they mentioned
both "Nobteook" and "Notebook." They want the iframe to point to localhost:8787
and change the initial state instead of using an API call. The user also
mentioned renaming "decopilot" to "notebook," but it's confusing since decopilot
is a docked chat and not a view. I need to locate where the initial menu items
are sourced. **Analyzing views and initial state**

In `WorkspaceViews`, I'm seeing that it uses `team?.views` from
`useCurrentTeam()`, and this data likely comes from the API or Supabase. There's
also a development-only seed in `AppSidebar` that uses `useApplyMenuViews` to
add views via the SDK, which still relies on the API. They want to change the
initial state without using the API, and I noticed `IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE`
in `use-iframe-menu-events.ts`, but it isn't currently applied. I need to figure
out how to adjust the initial state without affecting the API calls. **Exploring
view implementation options**

I’m considering how to apply our custom views. The simplest approach would be to
adjust the dev seeding, but that involves the API, which they want to avoid.
Another option is to set up a condition earlier in `WorkspaceViews` to derive
`views` from `IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE` if it’s not empty, ignoring
`team?.views`.

For the demo, I could convert `IFRAME_MENU_INITIAL_STATE` into the `View` shape
while bypassing the fetch. However, I need to ensure the items meet the expected
types. I’ll figure out how to mimic the "custom" type to satisfy
`WorkspaceViews`. **Setting up custom view navigation**

For the custom views that include `metadata.url`, it constructs a URL for
navigation based on `integrationId`, directing to
`/views/${integrationId}/index`. The `integrationId` is typically pulled from
`view.integrationId`, but if it's a custom type without one, it defaults to
'custom'.

However, since our provided view JSON lacks a `name` and includes an
`integration` object instead, I'll adjust. By setting `integrationId` to
"custom" and leaving out the name, it should navigate correctly to
`/views/custom/index?viewUrl=...`. **Implementing view replacement logic**

I’m working on replacing the "DECONFIG Branch Manager" view with "Notebook" and
updating the URL to localhost:8787. The current path requires an `integrationId`
and a view name, which is set to "index." Since the provided JSON lacks a
`name`, I’ll ensure the new setup still works by using the integration ID of the
DECONFIG integration.

To do this, I can map the `team?.views` array, replacing fields when there's a
match. I'll transform views where either the title is "DECONFIG Branch Manager"
or the integration ID matches. I’ll set up the mapping within `WorkspaceViews`
and ensure to maintain types. I'll check the icon as well, but I think sticking
to the existing icons will be fine, as they only asked to rename the view and
update the URL. **Preparing to implement code changes**

I’m planning to make some code edits, but I’ll leave `decopilot` untouched. The
import statement for `useEffect` is already in place, so that’s good.

This is a straightforward change in one file, so I’ll skip adding a todo list. I
need to ensure minimal status updates since I'm using tools.

The plan is to find the `useMemo` starting at line 461 and modify the code after
declaring `const views`. I’ll transform it to create `const mutatedViews`. I’ll
check TypeScript correctness while making these changes, casting `view.metadata`
as necessary. Now, I’m ready to apply the patch!</details></think>

---

I'll update the sidebar's `WorkspaceViews` to override the DECONFIG custom view
client-side: rename it to "Notebook" and set its URL to http://localhost:8787,
without touching API calls.

---

---

---

- I added a small client-side override in
  `apps/web/src/components/sidebar/index.tsx` inside `WorkspaceViews`’s view
  processing. It renames the DECONFIG item to “Notebook” and sets its URL to
  `http://localhost:8787/`, without touching API calls or the backend.
- This is a one-off demo tweak: it detects the existing DECONFIG view either by
  its title or by `integrationId` and adjusts only that item before rendering.

_**User (2025-09-07 22:29Z)**_

When I click in Notebook, the urls goes to
http://localhost:3000/deco/default/views/i:6956bf38-4201-4f56-bbc5-2ea1566cf465/index?viewUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8787%2F

and it says views doesn exist

In prod, it goes to
https://admin.decocms.com/deco/default/views/i:6956bf38-4201-4f56-bbc5-2ea1566cf465/index?viewUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdeconfig.deco.page%2F

and it works fine

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating connection view
logic**

I'm thinking the function uses a URL to match a view. It seems if there's no
match, it defaults to the provided URL, constructing `resolvedUrl` as needed.
When `connectionViewMatch` is falsy, it throws a `NotFoundError`, meaning they
must have this match to proceed. It’s interesting because it seems like in
production environments, connection views are expected, but not necessarily in
local development. To bypass this for the demo, I could modify
`WorkspaceViews.buildViewHrefFromView` to direct to a simple iframe instead. I’m
curious if there's a `Preview` component that can handle any URL. **Exploring
rendering options**

It looks like there isn’t a direct route for rendering the preview except within
`ViewDetail`. I’m considering adding a route like `/external?url=` to open an
iframe viewer. However, the user wants minimal changes, just a simple adjustment
to the initial state and renaming the decopilot view to link to localhost:8787.
The easiest option could be modifying `buildViewHrefFromView` to return a plain
workspace link for `viewUrl`, but it seems to fail due to the connection view
match requirement. I need to find a page component that can accept a URL query
for embedding directly. **Searching for preview route**

I'm considering the possibility of a route like `/preview?url=...`. It seems
like that could be a straightforward option for opening an iframe viewer
directly. I need to look into that and see if it exists or how I could set it
up. This might streamline the process and meet the user's needs without
requiring extensive changes. Let's explore the current routes and check if any
support this preview functionality!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reevaluating connection view
logic**

I see that the code uses findConnectionView to create a connectionViewMatch.
Maybe we can synthesize this by adding a type: custom view with integrationId
'custom' and a name like 'index,' but I'm still facing a NotFound issue. The
NotFound error doesn’t seem to come from team views but from connectionViews,
which are generated from useConnectionViews(integration). If integration is
undefined, we won't have an entry. A simpler adjustment could involve modifying
ViewDetail to allow a url-based preview. **Modifying ViewDetail logic**

I'm planning to implement changes in ViewDetail. After computing the URL, I want
to set a new constant for the URL parameter. I think I’ll use useMemo to create
a connectionViewMatch, checking if the URL is present first. Instead of invasive
changes, I’ll adjust the NotFound guard to allow cases when a URL exists. This
way, if there's no match and no URL, it throws a NotFoundError. Otherwise, it
renders the Preview with the resolved URL. I should also check the `src`
variable, as it seems undefined in the snippet I have.</details></think>

_**User (2025-09-07 22:29Z)**_

Don't show view not found. Override to show localhost:8787

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the view detail logic to gracefully fallback to previewing the
provided viewUrl instead of throwing "View not found" when no connection view is
configured.

---

Read file: undefined

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying tool usage**

I need to remember that for larger tasks, I’m supposed to use `todo_write`, but
since this is a simple edit, I don’t need a todo list. I should ensure that I
provide status updates before any tool calls, following the guidelines.
Previously, I called `read_file`, and now I’ll be applying a patch. I’ve
realized I need to include those status update lines before proceeding, like
saying, “I’ll update the view detail to fallback; now making the
edit.”</details></think>

---

I'll update the view details page to fallback to rendering the provided viewUrl
(localhost:8787) when no connection view is found, and default the title to
"Notebook". Now I'll make the edit.

---

---

---

- I added a fallback in `apps/web/src/components/views/detail.tsx`: if there’s
  no configured connection view but a `viewUrl` is present, it renders that URL
  directly and labels it “Notebook” instead of throwing “View not found”.
- Your sidebar override still sets the DECONFIG item to “Notebook” with
  `viewUrl=http://localhost:8787/`, and now clicking it will open the iframe
  regardless of backend view configuration.

_**User (2025-09-07 22:29Z)**_

Wjhere is the code youre overriding?

### Sidebar override (rename DECONFIG → Notebook + localhost:8787)

```470:489:apps/web/src/components/sidebar/index.tsx
const rawViews = (team?.views ?? []) as View[];
// One-off demo override: rename DECONFIG view to "Notebook" and point to localhost:8787
const views = rawViews.map((view) => {
  const deconfigIntegrationId = "i:6956bf38-4201-4f56-bbc5-2ea1566cf465";
  const isDeconfig =
    view.title === "DECONFIG Branch Manager" ||
    (view.integrationId as string | undefined) === deconfigIntegrationId;
  if (isDeconfig) {
    return {
      ...view,
      title: "Notebook",
      metadata: { ...((view.metadata as any) ?? {}), url: "http://localhost:8787/" },
    } as View;
  }
  return view;
});
```

### View fallback (don’t show “View not found”; render viewUrl)

```116:124:apps/web/src/components/views/detail.tsx
// Fallback: if no configured view found, but a viewUrl is present,
// render it directly to avoid "View not found" blocking demo flows.
const effectiveView = connectionViewMatch ?? (resolvedUrl
  ? { title: "Notebook", icon: "description", url: resolvedUrl }
  : undefined);
```

```153:159:apps/web/src/components/views/detail.tsx
<Icon
  name={effectiveView?.icon || "dashboard"}
  className="w-4 h-4"
/>
<span>{effectiveView?.title}</span>
```
