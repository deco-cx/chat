## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended) â€“ required for running the frontend development server and bundling assets.

- **deco CLI** â€“ the command-line interface for deco, which you can install via NPM.

- **Cloudflare Account** â€“ needed to deploy your app (Cloudflare Workers is the runtime).

- **Basic TypeScript knowledge** â€“ The project is TypeScript-heavy, so familiarity with TS is important (if you're new, see the official TypeScript docs for a primer).

## Project Setup with the CLI

Once your environment is ready, follow these steps to create a new deco project:

<StepGroup>
  <Step number={1} title="Create a project">
    Open your terminal and run:
    
    ```bash
    npm create deco@latest
    ```
    
    If you're not authenticated, this will your browser so you can log in or create an account,
    then initialize a project for you.
  </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Install dependencies">
    After scaffolding, `cd` into the project folder. If the project includes a frontend, run:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
    (or `pnpm install`) to install Node dependencies for the view.
  </Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Run the development server">
    Start your app locally with:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    This will spin up the development environment â€“ usually it runs the Cloudflare Worker (MCP server) on a local port (8787 by default) and a Vite dev server for the frontend, with hot-reload for both. Check the terminal output for the local URL (often something like `https://localhost-<hash>.deco.host`), and open it in your browser. You should see the default deco app interface loading.
    
    <Callout type="success">
      At this point, you have a running deco application on your machine! ðŸŽ‰
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</StepGroup>

## "Hello World" Example

Let's illustrate how you might add a simple "Hello World" tool to your app:

In your project's server code (e.g., `server/main.ts`), you can define a new Tool that returns a greeting:

```typescript
import { createTool } from "@deco/workers-runtime";
import { z } from "zod";

const createHelloTool = () =>
  createTool({
    id: "HELLO_TOOL",
    description: "Returns a hello message",
    inputSchema: z.object({ name: z.string() }),
    outputSchema: z.object({ greeting: z.string() }),
    execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
      return { greeting: `Hello, ${inputData.name}!` };
    },
  });
```

Here we use **Zod** to define that this tool expects a name (string) and outputs a greeting string. _(If you're unfamiliar with Zod: it's a TypeScript-friendly schema validation library that ensures inputs/outputs conform to the types your code expects.)_

Register this tool in the `withRuntime` setup (we'll explain this in _Project Structure_ next). Then run `deco configure` (if needed) and restart the dev server. Don't forget to run `deco gen` to update types (more on the gen command under **CLI Reference**).

Now you can test the tool. For example, using the deco UI or a curl request to the MCP endpoint, call the `HELLO_TOOL` with `{"name": "World"}` and see if you get back `{"greeting": "Hello, World!"}`.
