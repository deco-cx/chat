## Prerequisites

Before starting,  make sure you have:

- **Node.js** v22+ ([download here](https://nodejs.org))
- **Git** for version control
- **Code editor** (we recommend [Cursor](https://cursor.com) for AI-powered development)
- **Basic TypeScript knowledge** â€“ The project is TypeScript-heavy, so familiarity with TS is important (if youâ€™re new, see the official TypeScript docs for a primer).

## Creating a new App

<StepGroup>
  <Step number={1} title="Init your app">
    ```bash
    npm create deco@latest
    ```
    
    This may open your browser to authenticate. You can create a 
    new account if you don't have one.
    
    You will be prompted to link this app to a deco CMS project
    that you're part of.
  </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Start development">
    ```bash
    cd <your-app-name>
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    Your app's local server will start with hot reload enabled. 
    Copy the preview URL from the terminal output.
    The preview URL is accessible anywhere on the internet now.
    
    <Callout type="info">
      The local server can be accessed on port 8787 and serves 
      both a MCP app at `/mcp`, and a React view front-end at `/`.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</StepGroup>

## Test your MCP

Test your MCP server:

1. Go to your team on the [deco CMS](https://admin.decocms.com)
2. Click **Add Integration** â†’ **Custom Integration**
3. Paste your preview URL + `/mcp` (e.g., `https://localhost-abc123.deco.host/mcp`)
4. Save and test the default tools that come from the template

<Callout type="success">
  Your MCP server is now running locally and connected to deco! ðŸŽ‰
</Callout>

## Deploy to production

When ready to share your MCP:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

We deploy your app to Cloudflare Workers and becomes available on the private registry of your Team.
