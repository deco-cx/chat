## Prerequisites

Before starting,  make sure you have:

- **Node.js** v18+ ([download here](https://nodejs.org))
- **Git** for version control
- **Code editor** (we recommend [Cursor](https://cursor.com) for AI-powered development)
- **Basic TypeScript knowledge** â€“ The project is TypeScript-heavy, so familiarity with TS is important (if youâ€™re new, see the official TypeScript docs for a primer).

## Project Setup with the CLI

<StepGroup>
  <Step number={1} title="Install Deco CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g deco-cli
    ```
    
    Verify installation with `deco --help`.
  </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Login to deco.chat">
    ```bash
    deco login
    ```
    
    This opens your browser to authenticate. Create an account at [deco.chat](https://deco.chat) if you don't have one.
  </Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Create your project">
    ```bash
    deco create my-mcp-project
    ```
    
    - Choose your team/workspace
    - Select the default template (recommended)
    - Accept Git repository initialization
    - Configure IDE setup
  </Step>

  <Step number={4} title="Start development">
    ```bash
    cd my-mcp-project
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    Your MCP server will start with hot reload enabled. Copy the preview URL from the terminal output.
    
    <Callout type="info">
      The server runs on port 8787 and serves both MCP endpoints at `/mcp` and documentation assets.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</StepGroup>

## Test your MCP

Test your MCP server in deco.chat:

1. Go to your team in [deco.chat](https://deco.chat)
2. Click **Add Integration** â†’ **Custom Integration**
3. Paste your preview URL + `/mcp` (e.g., `https://localhost-abc123.deco.host/mcp`)
4. Save and test the default tools

<Callout type="success">
  Your MCP server is now running locally and connected to deco.chat! ðŸŽ‰
</Callout>

## Deploy to production

When ready to share your MCP:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Your app deploys to Cloudflare Workers and becomes available as a public integration in your workspace.
