## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended) â€“ required for running the frontend development server and bundling assets.

- **Deno** â€“ used to install and run the deco CLI. Deco's tooling is distributed as a Deno module.

- **deco.chat CLI** â€“ the command-line interface for deco.chat, which you can install via Deno.

- **Cloudflare Account** â€“ needed to deploy your app (Cloudflare Workers is the runtime).

- **Basic TypeScript knowledge** â€“ The project is TypeScript-heavy, so familiarity with TS is important (if you're new, see the official TypeScript docs for a primer).

## Project Setup with the CLI

Once your environment is ready, follow these steps to create a new deco.chat project:

### 1. Install the Deco CLI

Open your terminal and run:

```shell
deno install -Ar -g -n deco jsr:@deco/cli
```

This globally installs the deco command. (The CLI is published as a Deno module on the JSR registry.) After installation, you can run `deco --help` to verify it's working.

### 2. Log in to deco.chat

Use `deco login` to authenticate the CLI with your deco.chat account. A browser window will prompt you to sign in, and the CLI will store an API token for your session. (If you don't have an account, sign up on the deco.chat website first.)

### 3. Initialize a new project

Navigate to the directory where you want your project and run `deco init`. You'll be guided to pick a template (for example, a **React + Tailwind View** template or a minimal server-only template). The CLI will scaffold a project with the recommended structure. It will also prompt you to configure your workspace and app name (or you can run `deco configure` manually to set these).

### 4. Install dependencies

After scaffolding, `cd` into the project folder. If the project includes a frontend, run `npm install` (or `pnpm install`) to install Node dependencies for the view.

### 5. Run the development server

Start your app locally with:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will spin up the development environment â€“ usually it runs the Cloudflare Worker (MCP server) on a local port (8787 by default) and a Vite dev server for the frontend, with hot-reload for both. Check the terminal output for the local URL (often something like `https://localhost-<hash>.deco.host`), and open it in your browser. You should see the default deco.chat app interface loading.

At this point, you have a running deco.chat application on your machine! ðŸŽ‰

## "Hello World" Example

Let's illustrate how you might add a simple "Hello World" tool to your app:

In your project's server code (e.g., `server/main.ts`), you can define a new Tool that returns a greeting. For instance:

```ts
import { createTool } from "@deco/workers-runtime";
import { z } from "zod";

const createHelloTool = () =>
  createTool({
    id: "HELLO_TOOL",
    description: "Returns a hello message",
    inputSchema: z.object({ name: z.string() }),
    outputSchema: z.object({ greeting: z.string() }),
    execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
      return { greeting: `Hello, ${inputData.name}!` };
    },
  });
```

Here we use **Zod** to define that this tool expects a name (string) and outputs a greeting string. _(If you're unfamiliar with Zod: it's a TypeScript-friendly schema validation library that ensures inputs/outputs conform to the types your code expects.)_

Register this tool in the `withRuntime` setup (we'll explain this in _Project Structure_ next). Then run `deco configure` (if needed) and restart the dev server. Don't forget to run `deco gen` to update types (more on the gen command under **CLI Reference**).

Now you can test the tool. For example, using the deco UI or a curl request to the MCP endpoint, call the `HELLO_TOOL` with `{"name": "World"}` and see if you get back `{"greeting": "Hello, World!"}`.
