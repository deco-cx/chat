Here is a collection of useful links and resources regarding deco and its ecosystem:

## Core Documentation

- **Deco source (GitHub):** The platform's code is open-source. Check out the [deco.cx/chat repository on GitHub](https://github.com/deco-cx/chat) for the core codebase. It's a great reference to understand how things work under the hood, and you can even contribute or browse issues for insight.

## Framework Documentation

- **Mastra Framework Docs:** deco currently builds on top of the Mastra agent framework. 
To dive deeper into workflow patterns, agent design, and advanced features, visit the 
[Mastra Documentation](https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/control-flow). 
Key sections include the Workflows guide and API reference, which explain the 
`.then()`/`.parallel()`/`.branch()`/... syntax in detail.

- **Zod Documentation:** All input/output schemas in deco are defined with Zod. 
The [Zod official documentation](https://zod.dev/) is an excellent resource to learn about schema definitions, 
parsing, and error handling.

## Examples and Templates

- **Default template source code (deco-create):** This is the repo cloned to your machine when initializing a new app: [Deco create](https://github.com/deco-cx/deco-create)

## Infrastructure

- **Cloudflare Workers Docs:** Since your agent runs on Workers, the 
[Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) can be useful. 
Topics like accessible Web APIs, Durable Objects, Cron Triggers, and Wrangler are covered there.

- **Mastra GitHub & Examples:** If you're curious, the Mastra framework's source and example 
workflows are available (check the Mastra docs site for links). There are community examples 
like conditional branching and human-in-the-loop workflows that illustrate best practices.

## Community

- **deco Community & Support:** Engage with other developers building on deco. Often, others
have solved similar problems or can provide guidance on tricky integrations. [join our Discord here](https://deco.cx/discord)
