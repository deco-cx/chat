Here is a collection of useful links and resources related to deco.chat and its ecosystem:

## Core Documentation

- **deco.chat Source (GitHub):** The platform's code is open-source. Check out the [deco.cx/chat repository on GitHub](https://github.com/deco-cx/chat) for the core codebase. It's a great reference to understand how things work under the hood, and you can even contribute or browse issues for insight.

- **Deco CLI Documentation:** For details on CLI commands and options, see the **Deco CLI Reference** on the JSR package registry (which includes all commands and usage examples). This is essentially the README for `@deco/cli` and is kept up-to-date with the latest CLI version.

## Framework Documentation

- **Mastra Framework Docs:** deco.chat builds on the Mastra agent framework. To dive deeper into workflow patterns, agent design, and advanced features, visit the [Mastra Documentation](https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/control-flow). Key sections include the Workflows guide and API reference, which explain the `.then()`/`.parallel()`/`.branch()`/... syntax in detail.

- **Zod Documentation:** All input/output schemas in deco are defined with Zod. The [Zod official documentation](https://zod.dev/) is an excellent resource to learn about schema definitions, parsing, and error handling.

## Examples and Templates

- **Example Projects (deco Apps):** The deco.cx organization has an **apps** repository containing open-source MCP apps that power deco.chat. These can serve as real-world examples. You may find sample tools, workflows, and usage of various integrations there. It's a helpful way to see how a larger project is structured beyond the templates.

## Infrastructure

- **Cloudflare Workers Docs:** Since your agent runs on Workers, the [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) can be useful. Topics like environment variables, Durable Objects, Cron Triggers, and Wrangler are covered there.

- **Mastra GitHub & Examples:** If you're curious, the Mastra framework's source and example workflows are available (check the Mastra docs site for links). There are community examples like conditional branching and human-in-the-loop workflows that illustrate best practices.

## Community

- **deco.chat Community & Support:** Engage with other developers building on deco.chat. Often, others have solved similar problems or can provide guidance on tricky integrations.

- **GitHub Repos for Integrations:** Some integrations might have their own repos or reference docs (e.g., deco-cx/actors library for Durable Object actors, or deco-cx/vibeflare for a CMS integration). Explore the deco-cx GitHub organization for these ancillary projects.
