## General Questions

### Can I use OpenAI, Anthropic, or my own model?

Yes. Add the integration in the dashboard, regenerate types, and call it from a tool.

### Do I need a front-end?

No. You can deploy server-only projects for API-first use cases.

### How do I store secrets?

Cloudflare environment variables → they surface in `env.INTEGRATION_NAME`.

### Where are logs?

`deco logs` locally, or Cloudflare Dash → Workers → Logs.

## Development Questions

### How do I add a new tool?

1. Define the tool in `server/main.ts` using `createTool`
2. Add it to the `withRuntime` tools array
3. Run `npm run gen` to update types
4. Test it via the deco UI or RPC client

### How do I connect to an external API?

1. Add the integration via the deco.chat dashboard
2. Run `npm run gen` to get typed interfaces
3. Use `env.INTEGRATION_NAME.method()` in your tools

### How do I deploy my app?

Run `deco deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare Workers. The CLI will handle building and publishing.

### How do I debug my workflows?

Use `console.log` in your tools and workflow steps. Check the terminal output during development or use `wrangler tail` for production logs.

## Technical Questions

### What's the difference between tools and workflows?

Tools are single functions that perform specific tasks. Workflows orchestrate multiple tools with logic, conditions, and loops.

### Can I use my own database?

Yes. You can use Cloudflare D1, Workers KV, or connect to external databases via HTTP APIs.

### How do I handle authentication?

Store API keys as Cloudflare environment variables. They'll be available in your `env` object.

### What are the Cloudflare Workers limits?

Free tier: 50ms CPU time per request. Paid tiers: up to 30s with Workers Unbound. Check the [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) for current limits.

## Integration Questions

### Which integrations are available?

Many common services like Slack, Gmail, Notion, Stripe, and more. Check the deco.chat dashboard for the full list.

### Can I create custom integrations?

Yes, you can write custom tools that call any HTTP API using `fetch`.

### How do I use the Knowledge Base?

Upload documents via the deco.chat UI. The platform will index them and make them available to your agents automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### My tool isn't working

1. Check that it's registered in `withRuntime`
2. Verify your Zod schemas
3. Check the logs for errors
4. Ensure you ran `npm run gen` after changes

### My workflow isn't executing

1. Make sure you called `.commit()` at the end
2. Check that all steps are properly chained
3. Verify your input/output schemas match

### The RPC client doesn't have my new tool

Run `DECO_SELF_URL=<your-dev-url> npm run gen:self` to generate types for your own tools.

### Deployment failed

1. Check your Cloudflare credentials
2. Ensure the frontend builds without errors
3. Verify your `wrangler.toml` configuration
