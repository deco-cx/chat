## Development Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I add a new tool?" icon="Wrench">
    1. Define the tool in `server/main.ts` using `createTool`
    2. Add it to the `withRuntime` tools array
    3. Run `npm run gen` to update types
    4. Test it via the deco UI or RPC client
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I connect to an external API?" icon="Globe">
    1. Add the integration via the deco.chat dashboard
    2. Run `npm run gen` to get typed interfaces
    3. Use `env.INTEGRATION_NAME.method()` in your tools
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I deploy my app?" icon="Rocket">
    Run `deco deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare Workers. The CLI will handle building and publishing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I debug my workflows?" icon="Bug">

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between tools and workflows?" icon="Settings">
    Tools are single functions that perform specific tasks. Workflows orchestrate multiple tools with logic, conditions, and loops.

    Yes. You can use Cloudflare D1, Workers KV, or connect to external databases via HTTP APIs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle authentication?" icon="Shield">
    Store API keys as Cloudflare environment variables. They'll be available in your `env` object.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the Cloudflare Workers limits?" icon="Gauge">
    Free tier: 50ms CPU time per request. Paid tiers: up to 30s with Workers Unbound. Check the [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) for current limits.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My tool isn't working" icon="AlertCircle">
    1. Check that it's registered in `withRuntime`

    4. Ensure you ran `npm run gen` after changes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My workflow isn't executing" icon="AlertTriangle">
