# Getting Started

Welcome to deco.chat! This guide will help you create your first MCP server with a beautiful documentation site.

<StepGroup>
  <Step number={1} title="Install the CLI">
    Run the following command to install the deco CLI:
    
    ```bash
    deno install -Ar -g -n deco jsr:@deco/cli
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Authenticate">
    Log in to your deco.chat account:
    
    ```bash
    deco login
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Create a new project">
    Initialize a new deco.chat app in your current directory:
    
    ```bash
    deco create
    ```
    
    This will set up a complete project with both the MCP server and documentation site.
  </Step>

  <Step number={4} title="Start development">
    Navigate to your project directory and start the development server:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    This starts both the MCP server and the documentation site with hot reload.
  </Step>

  <Step number={5} title="Deploy to production">
    When you're ready to deploy:
    
    ```bash
    deco deploy
    ```
    
    Your app will be available at a public URL with both the MCP server and documentation.
