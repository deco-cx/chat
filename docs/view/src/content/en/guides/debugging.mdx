Building AI agents and workflows can be tricky at times. Here are some tips and common issues to watch out for, along with strategies to debug them:

## Logs are your friend

Use `console.log` generously in your tool and workflow code while developing. When running `npm run dev`, you'll see these logs in your terminal (the Cloudflare Worker logs). For production, you can use `wrangler tail` to stream logs from the live worker, or view logs in Cloudflare's dashboard. Logging the inputs and outputs of tools can help understand what the agent is doing. _(Just be cautious not to log sensitive info in production.)_

## Type Errors (Compilation issues)

If TypeScript is complaining, check your schemas and types. A common mistake is forgetting to regenerate types after adding a new tool or integration – if you add a tool and try to call it from the client without updating `deco.gen.ts`, the `client.tools` won't have it. Run `npm run gen` (to pull latest integration types) and `DECO_SELF_URL=<dev-url> npm run gen:self` (to update self tool types) whenever you change tools/workflows. Also ensure your Zod schemas and TypeScript `Env` agree on structure. Most "type errors" during build can be resolved by syncing these up.

## Integration Errors

If a tool that calls an external integration fails, verify the integration setup:

- Did you connect the service in the deco UI and grant permissions?
- Are your API keys or credentials correct and not expired?
- Check the `env` usage: e.g., `env.GMAIL.sendEmail` will only exist if the Gmail integration is configured in that workspace. If it's undefined, the integration may not be added or the `deco.gen.ts` is outdated.
- Look at the error message or status code from the external API (you can catch errors in your tool and log `e.response` etc.). It might be a 401 (auth issue), 400 (bad request payload), etc. Adjust your code or config accordingly.

## Workflow Logic Errors

If your workflow isn't doing what you expect:

- Check the data flow between steps. Are you using `.map()` when needed to shape data? If a step isn't getting the right input, perhaps the previous step's output schema doesn't match its input schema. Use `console.log` in map functions or just before a step to inspect context.
- Ensure you called `.commit()` at the end of workflow definition. Forgetting to commit will usually result in the workflow not being registered at all.
- If using `.branch()`, ensure your conditions cover the cases and that at least one condition returns true (or else none of the branch steps will run).
- For loops (`.dountil`/`.dowhile`), ensure the loop condition will eventually become true or false appropriately. Otherwise you might end up with an infinite loop (which Cloudflare would terminate once it hits CPU/time limits). Always test loop logic with dummy data.

## Frontend Issues

If nothing happens when you click a button in the UI:

- Open browser dev tools. Check the console for errors (maybe a JS error in your React code).
- Check the network tab – is the RPC call being made? If you see a failed request, examine it. A 404 might mean the tool/workflow isn't found (possibly not registered or naming mismatch). A 500 means an error thrown in the worker (check worker logs).
- Ensure the client is imported from the correct path and that you ran the gen scripts so it has the latest structure.

## Deployment Problems

If `deco deploy` fails:

- Review the error output. It might be an authentication issue (e.g., Cloudflare API token not set – make sure you did `deco login` with a Cloudflare-linked account or that `wrangler.toml` has the correct credentials).
- Could be a build error – ensure the frontend builds without errors first (`npm run build`).
- If deploy succeeds but app doesn't work, ensure your `wrangler.toml` has the correct `account_id` and route or `workers.dev` subdomain configured. You might be deploying but not actually routing any traffic if misconfigured. The quick way is to try opening the `workers.dev` URL that corresponds to your app name.

## Common Runtime Errors

A few things we've seen:

- **"Service not available or Env not configured"** – This usually means you tried to call an integration that isn't configured in this environment. Check integration names in `Env`. For example, using `env.SOMEAPI.fetchData` will throw if `SOMEAPI` isn't added. Solution: add the integration or guard the call.

- **JSON serialization issues** – If your tool returns something not serializable (like a complex class instance), it might not cross the worker boundary. Return plain objects or values that can be JSON-stringified.

- **Exceeding limits** – If a workflow consistently fails after some time, maybe you hit a Worker CPU time limit (long loops, etc.). In such cases, consider if the work can be split, or if you should use Durable Objects or schedule to break it up. Also note, if you upload a very large file to Knowledge Base and then try to use it all at once, you could be sending a huge context to the LLM, which might hit token limits or timeouts.

## Testing incrementally

Build your agent piece by piece. Test each tool individually (you can call tools from the deco UI's agent playground or even via `client.tools` in an ad-hoc test component). Test workflows with simpler sub-steps before adding all branches. This will isolate issues.

## Community and Support

If you're stuck, the deco community (Discord or forums) can be helpful. Also, Cloudflare Workers documentation is relevant since many issues might actually be generic Workers issues (like how do I store a secret, etc.). Don't hesitate to consult Cloudflare's docs for Workers specifics.

## Key Tips Recap

- Use `console.log` extensively during dev.
- Keep schemas in sync and run codegen (gen) after changes.
- Validate assumptions at each step (print inputs/outputs).
- Handle errors gracefully in tools (maybe output an `{ error: ... }` instead of throwing).
- Leverage the "Read more" references provided to deepen your understanding of underlying technologies (Mastra, Zod, Cloudflare Workers). There's a lot of power under the hood!
