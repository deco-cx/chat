Deploy your MCP server to Cloudflare Workers with one command. Your entire stack runs serverless on Cloudflare's global edge network.

## Deploy Process

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command:
1. **Build frontend**: Optimizes React app into static assets
2. **Bundle server**: Packages MCP server code and dependencies  
3. **Upload to Workers**: Deploys to Cloudflare with asset bindings
4. **Live at URL**: App available at `https://your-app.deco.page`

## What Gets Deployed

- **MCP Server**: Available at `/mcp` endpoint for AI agents
- **React App**: Web interface served from root
- **Database**: SQLite with isolated workspace data
- **Integrations**: OAuth tokens and API credentials (encrypted)

## Runtime Environment

Your code runs on Cloudflare's global edge network with automatic scaling and low latency worldwide.

### Performance Limits

- **CPU Time**: 50ms free tier, up to 30s with Workers Unbound
- **Async I/O**: API calls and database queries don't count against CPU time
- **Request Volume**: Monitor usage in Cloudflare dashboard

<Callout type="info">
  Cloudflare suspends workers during fetch calls, so most MCP operations complete within limits.
</Callout>

### Advanced Capabilities

**Durable Objects**: For stateful interactions beyond conversation context. Maintain persistent state across requests using single-instance workers.

**Cron Triggers**: Schedule agents to run periodically. Set up in deco.chat UI, then deploy to update `wrangler.toml`.

**Usage Monitoring**: Track request count, errors, CPU time, and set billing alerts in the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Custom Domains

Map your own domain (e.g., `ai.mycompany.com`):

1. Add domain to Cloudflare DNS
2. Configure custom domain in Workers dashboard  
3. Update DNS records to point to worker

Alternative: Embed in iframe or use the provided `.deco.page` URL.

## Testing Deployment

Always verify your production deployment:

```bash
# Test MCP endpoint
curl https://your-app.deco.page/mcp

# List your deployed apps
deco hosting list -w <workspace>
```

**Manual Verification**:
- Open production URL, ensure frontend loads
- Test agent interactions and tool responses
- Verify integrations work with production credentials
- Check database operations and data persistence

## Updates and Rollbacks

If something goes wrong, update your code and deploy again. Cloudflare doesn't have built-in CLI rollbacks, but deployments are fast enough to redeploy an earlier stable version. Use version control to revert changes locally, then redeploy. You can set up CI to deploy on git pushes, but manual deploys work fine for most cases. In teams, coordinate deployments so only one person deploys at a time to avoid version conflicts.
