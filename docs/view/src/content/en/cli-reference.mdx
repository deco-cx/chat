The **deco CLI** is your friend for managing projects and deployment. Here are some commonly used commands:

## Authentication Commands

Authenticate with deco.chat (prompts for your credentials). Do this once to allow the CLI to act on behalf of your account:

```bash
deco login
```

Log out of the CLI, or check which account is currently logged in:

```bash
deco logout
deco whoami
```

## Project Management

Initialize a new deco.chat app. This sets up boilerplate code in the current directory (or a new directory) using a chosen template. It's the easiest way to start a project without manual configuration:

```bash
deco create
```

Set or update the workspace/app configuration for the current project. If you didn't configure during init, run this to link your local code with a deco.chat workspace and application name:

```bash
deco configure
```

## Development Commands

_(Coming soon)_ Run your app in development mode. In practice, you will usually run `npm run dev`, which under the hood starts both the local Worker and frontend. A future CLI version may include `deco dev` to streamline this, but currently you use the `deco link` command for remote dev access (see below).

```bash
npm run dev
```

Expose your local dev server to a temporary public URL. This is useful if you want to connect an external AI client (like the Cursor IDE or Claude Desktop) to your locally running MCP server. It effectively tunnels your `npm run dev` server so that cloud-based LLMs can reach it. Usage: `deco link npm run dev` (the CLI will run your dev command and provide a URL):

```bash
deco link npm run dev
```

## Deployment Commands

Deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers. This command bundles your code and uploads it to your Cloudflare account (using the config in `wrangler.toml`). You can specify `--workspace` and `--app` flags if you have multiple, but usually the CLI knows your current project settings.

```bash
deco deploy
```

## Type Generation Commands

- **`deco gen`:** Generate types for external integrations. This updates your `deco.gen.ts` file with typed interfaces for all the integrations you've connected in your deco workspace.

```bash
npm run gen
```

- **`deco gen:self`:** Generate types for your own tools and workflows. This creates typed RPC interfaces for your own server's tools/workflows. Run this after adding new tools or workflows to your server.

```bash
DECO_SELF_URL=<your-dev-url> npm run gen:self
```

## Utility Commands

- **`deco update`:** Update the CLI to the latest version (handy to get new features).

```bash
deco update
```

## Getting Help

- **`deco --help`:** Show all available commands and their usage.

```bash
deco --help
```

For a full list of commands, see the CLI documentation or run `deco --help`. The CLI covers additional topics like listing deployments, environment setup, etc. It's constantly evolving.
